This project features the database to run a small Gym. It is planned that the database will be used through a desktop application for the employees and will also be accessed by the Gym users through the website. 

Gym operation description:

Anyone can visit the Gym whether they are subscribed or just walk in. The Gym provides access to its facilities (Cardio Area and Weight Area ) through annual or monthly subscription or on a pay-per-visit basis.

Users can subscribe online or through a receptionist, and the receptionist is responsible to verify the subscription. Subscribed users can book visits online and non-subscribed users cannot book visits online and need to call a reception or show up at the front desk. Receptionists record visits, admit subscribed or non subscribed users, provided that there is physical capacity available in the Cardio Area and the Weight Area. Lockers are provided to the users as needed. 

The capacity is automatically verified by the system (website or desktop application) and the booking is accepted or refused, when it is done online. 

When booking is done by phone, the reception verifies and accepts or refuses, using the same automated system.

When presenting themselves at the front desk, walk-in users have to choose the Area that they will use, given that there is capacity at that specific time.

Only Subscribed users can have a trainer. Subscribed users can be trained by up to one trainer. Trainers can train members either in the Cardio Area or in the Weight Area.

Payments per visit are made by non subscribed user, while Subscribed users make monthly or yearly payments.  

The database contains the following tables:
- User
- Receptionist
- Trainer
- Subscription
- Visit
- Payment 
- Cardio Area
- Weight Area
- Locker
